A Biometric Horror Game set in Outer Space.
Created in a team of 6, in 8 months:
- Unity Game Engine
- Coded in C#

In The Space Between, your fear isn’t just a feeling—it’s the enemy. 

🫀 Use your real heartbeat to survive... or risk losing your grip entirely.

🛰️ Navigate the cold corridors of a derelict station.  

🔧 Perform your duties. Hold your breath.  

💀 And whatever you do… don’t let it know you’re scared.
